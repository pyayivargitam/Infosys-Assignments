**ImpactSense - Earthquake Impact Prediction**

Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the impact of earthquakes by estimating magnitude, damage severity, or risk categories. It leverages geophysical and environmental data such as latitude, longitude, seismic depth, and geological features for impact assessment, aiding in early disaster planning and emergency response.

Use Cases
Urban Risk Analysis: Predict high-risk areas using historical earthquake and soil data.

Infrastructure Planning: Guide city constructions in vulnerable zones based on risk scores.

Disaster Management: Prioritize rescue and relief efforts effectively using impact forecasts.

Learning Outcomes
Grasp seismic data interpretation and its applications.

Perform data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering.

Train and evaluate various ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Optionally develop a user interface for impact prediction.

Document findings with clear metrics and visuals.

Dataset Source
Kaggle earthquake datasets with geospatial and seismic data points.

System Architecture & Modules
Milestones & Weekly Goals:

Milestone 1: Data loading, initial exploration, and feature preprocessing.

Milestone 2: Baseline and advanced model training with tuning.

Milestone 3: Model evaluation, explainability via SHAP, and UI prototype.

Milestone 4: Robust testing, improvements, final reporting, and presentation.

Modules include data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and optional UI development.

Evaluation Metrics
Classification: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

Regression: MAE, MSE, and RÂ² for damage estimation.

Feature importance via SHAP or other methods.

Training curves to monitor model bias or variance.
